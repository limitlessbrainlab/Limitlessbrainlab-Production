## Common Issues and Fixes:

### Issue 1: Password is NULL or Empty in Database ❌

**This means the password didn't save when you changed it!**

**Fix:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Open SQL Editor
3. Run this query to set the password:

```sql
UPDATE clinics
SET password = 'YourNewPassword'
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

Replace `'YourNewPassword'` with the actual password you want.

---

### Issue 2: Password in Database is Different ❌

**Example:**
- You entered: `NewPass123`
- Database has: `OldPass456`

**This means:**
- Either the password didn't save correctly
- Or you're trying the wrong password

**Fix Option A - Update password in database:**
```sql
UPDATE clinics
SET password = 'NewPass123'
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

**Fix Option B - Try login with the password shown in database**

---

### Issue 3: Clinic is Not Active ❌

**Check the "Is Active" column**

If it says "No", activate it:

```sql
UPDATE clinics
SET is_active = true
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

---

## After Using Debug Tool

### If Password Matches in Database:

1. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press `F12` to open console
   - Run these commands:
   ```javascript
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Try login again** on `localhost:3000/login`

3. **Check browser console** (F12) for these logs:
   ```
   🔍 Searching for clinic with email: hope@gmail.com
   ✅ Clinic found in local database with matching password
   ```

---

### If Password Doesn't Match:

**Option 1: Update password in database to match what you want**
```sql
UPDATE clinics
SET password = 'YourPassword'
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

**Option 2: Use the password that's in the database**
- Just login with whatever password is shown in the database

---

## Quick SQL Queries for Debugging

### Check current password:
```sql
SELECT email, password, is_active, contact_person
FROM clinics
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

### Update password:
```sql
UPDATE clinics
SET password = 'NewPassword123'
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

### Activate clinic:
```sql
UPDATE clinics
SET is_active = true
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

### See all clinics:
```sql
SELECT email, password, is_active FROM clinics;
```

## What to Send Me

After using the debug tool, please send me:

1. **Screenshot of "Check Password in Database" result**
2. **Screenshot of "Test Login Logic" result**
3. **What password you're trying to use**
4. **What password the database shows**

This will help me understand exactly what's wrong!

---

## Most Likely Issue

Based on the code, the most likely problem is:

**The password field in the clinics table is NULL or empty**

This happens if:
1. The clinic was created before we added password saving
2. The password update in Profile Modal failed
3. The password field wasn't included when creating the clinic

**Solution:**
Run this SQL to set the password manually:

```sql
UPDATE clinics
SET password = 'Hope@1234'  -- or whatever password you want
WHERE email = 'hope@gmail.com';
```

Then try login with that password!
