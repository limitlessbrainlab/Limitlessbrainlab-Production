# Gemini API Quota Error - Fixed ✅

## Problem
The console was showing error 429 (Too Many Requests) when trying to process QEEG files because the Gemini API free tier quota (20 requests/day) was exceeded.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Frontend Error Handling (`AlgorithmDataProcessor.jsx`)
- ✅ Added specific error handling for 429 (quota exceeded) errors
- ✅ Displays user-friendly message with solutions
- ✅ Handles both quota errors and general Gemini API errors
- ✅ Provides clear instructions on how to resolve the issue

### 2. Backend Error Handling (`qeegRoutes.js`)
- ✅ Enhanced error detection for quota-related errors
- ✅ Automatically categorizes quota errors (429 status code)
- ✅ Returns detailed error messages with actionable solutions
- ✅ Provides cache information to help users avoid quota consumption

### 3. Parser Error Handling (`qeegParser.js`)
- ✅ Already had retry logic with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s delays)
- ✅ Properly throws GEMINI_QUOTA_EXCEEDED error after max retries
- ✅ Includes file caching to avoid re-processing same files

## Solutions for Users

### Immediate Solutions (No Cost)
1. **Wait for Quota Reset**
   - Quota resets daily at midnight PST
   - Usually takes a few hours to reset

2. **Use File Cache**
   - Re-upload the SAME files you processed before
   - The system caches them by MD5 hash
   - Cached files don't consume quota!

3. **Check Cache Stats**
   - Look at backend console for cache hit/miss statistics
   - If you see "CACHE HIT", no quota was used

### Long-term Solutions
1. **Upgrade Gemini API Plan**
   - Visit: https://ai.google.dev/pricing
   - Paid plans have much higher quotas

2. **Alternative: Use Multiple API Keys**
   - Rotate between different API keys
   - Each key gets 20 free requests/day

## Error Message Users Will See

```
⚠️ API Quota Exceeded

The Gemini AI service has reached its daily request limit.

Solutions:
• Wait for quota reset (usually resets at midnight PST)
• Re-upload the same files (cached, no quota used)
• Contact administrator to upgrade API plan

## How to Monitor Quota Usage

### Backend Console
Check the server console for messages like:
- `✅ CACHE HIT! Using cached extraction result` ← No quota used
- `⚠️ Cache miss - extracting data with Gemini AI...` ← Quota consumed
- `📊 Cache Stats: X hits, Y misses, Z% hit rate`

### Cache Statistics
The system tracks:
- Total extractions
- Cache hits (no quota used)
- Cache misses (quota consumed)
- Hit rate percentage

## Testing the Fix

1. Try uploading QEEG files
2. If quota exceeded:
   - You'll see a user-friendly error message
   - Message explains what happened
   - Message provides clear solutions

3. Try uploading the same files again:
   - Should use cache (no quota consumed)
   - Console shows "CACHE HIT!"

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `src/components/admin/AlgorithmDataProcessor.jsx` (lines 426-443)
2. `server/routes/qeegRoutes.js` (lines 551-596)

### Error Codes
- `GEMINI_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` - Quota limit reached
- Status 429 - Too Many Requests (HTTP standard)

### Cache Mechanism
- Files are cached by MD5 hash + condition + report type
- Cache key format: `{md5hash}_{EO/EC}_{raw/zscore}`
- Cache persists in memory (resets on server restart)

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Error handling improved
2. ✅ User messages are clear and helpful
3. ⏳ Wait for quota reset OR upgrade API plan
4. ✅ System will automatically use cache for previously processed files

## Questions?

If users ask about the error:
1. Explain it's a daily limit from Google
2. Suggest waiting a few hours
3. Mention that re-uploading same files won't use quota
4. Provide link to upgrade: https://ai.google.dev/pricing
