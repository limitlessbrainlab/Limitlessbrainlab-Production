# Gemini API Quota Increase Guide

## Problem: API Quota Exceeded Error

You're seeing this error even with billing enabled:
```
Error: ⚠️ API Quota Exceeded
Google Gemini API has reached its free tier limit.
```

## Root Cause

**Even with billing enabled, your Google Cloud project still has DEFAULT quota limits set to free tier values.**

- **Free tier default**: 20 requests/day, 2 requests/minute
- **Billing enabled ≠ Automatic quota increase**
- You must **manually request quota increases** after enabling billing

## Solution: Request Quota Increase

### Step 1: Verify Billing is Enabled

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console - Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2. Select your project (the one with your API key)
3. Verify billing account is linked and active
4. Check payment method is valid

### Step 2: Enable "Pay as you go" for Generative Language API

1. Go to [AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/prompts/new_chat)
2. Check the pricing tier displayed
3. If it says "Free tier", click to upgrade to "Pay as you go"
4. This enables paid tier features and higher quotas

### Step 3: Request Quota Increase in Google Cloud Console

1. **Navigate to Quotas Page:**
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/api/generativelanguage.googleapis.com/quotas
   ```

2. **Select Your Project:**
   - Use the project dropdown at top
   - Choose the project containing your API key

3. **Filter Quotas:**
   - Filter by "Requests per minute" and "Requests per day"
   - Look for these quotas:
     - `Requests per minute per project`
     - `Requests per day per project`

4. **Request Increase:**
   - Click on each quota limit
   - Click "EDIT QUOTAS" button
   - Fill out the quota increase request form:
     - **New Limit**: Request what you need (e.g., 1000 requests/day, 60 requests/minute)
     - **Reason**: "Production application processing QEEG brain analysis reports for patients"
   - Submit the request

5. **Wait for Approval:**
   - Usually approved within 24-48 hours
   - You'll receive email notification
   - Some increases are instant, others require manual review

### Step 4: Verify New Quotas

After approval, verify in your app:

1. **Check via API endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status
   ```

2. **Check in Google Cloud Console:**
   - Go back to quotas page
   - Verify new limits are reflected

## Alternative: Use Vertex AI (Recommended for Production)

Vertex AI has better quota management and higher default limits:

1. **Enable Vertex AI API:**
   ```
   https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/aiplatform.googleapis.com
   ```

2. **Update your code** to use Vertex AI SDK instead of Generative Language API
   - Vertex AI quotas: Much higher (thousands of requests/minute)
   - Better for production workloads
   - More enterprise features

3. **Code change required:**
   ```javascript
   // Instead of:
   const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require('@google/generative-ai');

   // Use:
   const { VertexAI } = require('@google-cloud/vertexai');
   ```

## Current Rate Limiting in Your App

The app now has built-in rate limiting to prevent hitting quotas too quickly:

### Configuration (Environment Variables)

Add these to your `.env` file to customize:

```env
# Gemini API Quota Configuration
GEMINI_DAILY_LIMIT=20              # Free tier: 20, Paid tier: 1000+
GEMINI_REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE=2       # Free tier: 2, Paid tier: 60+
GEMINI_REQUEST_DELAY_MS=30000      # 30 seconds between requests (default)
```

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Delays:**
   - 30 seconds enforced between each API call
   - Prevents hitting rate limits

2. **Quota Tracking:**
   - Tracks daily and per-minute usage
   - Throws error when quota exhausted

3. **Smart Caching:**
   - Re-uploading SAME files uses cache (no quota consumed)
   - Cache is based on PDF file hash

### Check Quota Status

**Via API:**
```bash
GET http://localhost:5000/api/qeeg/quota-status
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "quota": {
    "daily": {
      "used": 12,
      "limit": 20,
      "remaining": 8,
      "percentUsed": "60.0%",
      "status": "OK"
    },
    "minute": {
      "used": 1,
      "limit": 2
    },
    "lastRequest": "2025-01-09T10:30:00.000Z",
    "nextReset": "2025-01-10T00:00:00.000Z",
    "hoursUntilReset": "13.5"
  },
  "recommendations": [
    "Quota is healthy. You can process 4 more patients today."
  ]
}
```

## Pricing Information

### Free Tier (No Billing)
- **Limit**: 20 requests/day, 2 requests/minute
- **Cost**: $0
- **Best for**: Testing, development, personal projects

### Pay-as-you-go (Billing Enabled + Quota Increase)
- **Default after increase**: 1000+ requests/day, 60+ requests/minute
- **Cost**: ~$0.00025 per request (varies by model)
- **Example**: 100 requests/day = ~$0.025/day = ~$0.75/month
- **Best for**: Production applications

### Vertex AI (Enterprise)
- **Limit**: Thousands of requests/minute
- **Cost**: Similar to Generative Language API
- **Features**: Better quota management, SLA, enterprise support
- **Best for**: Large-scale production deployments

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Quota exceeded" even after billing enabled

**Cause:** Billing enabled but quotas not increased.

**Solution:** Follow Step 3 above to request quota increase.

---

### Issue: "Quota increase request denied"

**Cause:** Google requires usage history or business justification.

**Solution:**
1. Use free tier for a few days to establish usage pattern
2. Provide detailed business case in quota request
3. Contact Google Cloud support for assistance

---

### Issue: "API key works in AI Studio but not in app"

**Cause:** API key might be from different project than billing-enabled one.

**Solution:**
1. Verify API key is from the correct project
2. Delete old API key
3. Create new API key in the billing-enabled project
4. Update `.env` file with new key

---

### Issue: "Still getting quota errors with high limits"

**Cause:** App might be making too many concurrent requests.

**Solution:**
1. Check app rate limiting is enabled
2. Increase `GEMINI_REQUEST_DELAY_MS` in `.env`
3. Monitor quota usage via `/api/qeeg/quota-status` endpoint

## Summary

1. ✅ **Enable Billing** on Google Cloud project
2. ✅ **Upgrade to "Pay as you go"** in AI Studio
3. ✅ **Request Quota Increase** in Google Cloud Console quotas page
4. ✅ **Wait for approval** (24-48 hours)
5. ✅ **Update .env** with new limits after approval
6. ✅ **Monitor usage** via `/api/qeeg/quota-status` endpoint

**Current Status with Rate Limiting:**
- Your app now enforces 30-second delays between API calls
- Automatically tracks daily usage
- Prevents exceeding quotas
- Works within free tier limits (10 patients/day max)
- Ready to scale up when quota increase is approved
