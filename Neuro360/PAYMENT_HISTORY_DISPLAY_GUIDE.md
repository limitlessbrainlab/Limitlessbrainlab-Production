## 🔧 Why You're Seeing "No payments found"

The payment history will show once:

### Step 1: Apply Database Migrations ⚠️ IMPORTANT

The `payment_history` table needs to be created first!

**Go to Supabase SQL Editor and run:**

```sql
-- Fixed migration script
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS payment_history CASCADE;

CREATE TABLE payment_history (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  payment_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  order_id VARCHAR(255),
  signature VARCHAR(512),
  clinic_id UUID REFERENCES clinics(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
  currency VARCHAR(3) DEFAULT 'INR',
  status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  package_id VARCHAR(100),
  package_name VARCHAR(255),
  reports INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  plan_details JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  subscription JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  payment_details JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  provider VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'razorpay',
  ip_address VARCHAR(45),
  user_agent TEXT,
  metadata JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE INDEX idx_payment_history_payment_id ON payment_history(payment_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_history_clinic_id ON payment_history(clinic_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_history_status ON payment_history(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_payment_history_created_at ON payment_history(created_at DESC);

CREATE TRIGGER update_payment_history_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON payment_history
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

ALTER TABLE payment_history ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow all operations on payment_history"
  ON payment_history FOR ALL USING (true);
```

### Step 2: Make a Test Payment

1. Go to http://localhost:3001
2. Login as clinic user (Hope clinic)
3. Click on "Subscription" tab
4. Click "Purchase Reports" button
5. Select a package
6. Complete payment with Razorpay

### Step 3: Check Payment Was Saved

**Browser Console should show:**
```
💾 FRONTEND-ONLY: Storing payment data: {...}
🔄 Updating clinic subscription: {...}
✅ Updated clinic Hope clinic - Added 5 reports (Total: 15)
✅ Clinic subscription updated successfully
💾 STORAGE: Saving payment record to database: pay_xxxxx
✅ STORAGE: Payment successfully saved to database
📋 Loading payment history for clinic: uuid-xxx
✅ Payment history loaded: 1 payments
```

**Supabase Database:**
```sql
-- Verify payment was saved
SELECT * FROM payment_history
WHERE clinic_id = 'your-clinic-id'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Step 4: View Payment History

1. Go to **Subscription & Billing** page
2. Click on **"Payment History"** tab
3. You should now see your payment in the table!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: "No payments found" after completing payment

**Check Console Logs:**
```javascript
// Should see:
✅ STORAGE: Payment successfully saved to database
📋 Loading payment history for clinic: uuid-xxx
✅ Payment history loaded: 1 payments
```

**If you see errors:**
- `❌ Database save failed` → Run the migration script (Step 1)
- `❌ Clinic not found` → Verify clinic exists and clinicId is correct
- `payment_history table does not exist` → Create the table with migration

**Solutions:**
1. Verify migrations were applied (check Supabase)
2. Clear browser cache and refresh
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify clinicId is correct

### Issue 2: Payment saved but not showing in table

**Refresh the page:**
- Click the refresh icon in Current Plan section
- Or refresh the browser page

**Check database directly:**
```sql
-- Verify data exists
SELECT
  payment_id,
  clinic_id,
  package_name,
  amount,
  status,
  created_at
FROM payment_history
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Issue 3: Wrong clinic ID

**Check user's clinic ID:**
```javascript
// In browser console:
console.log('User:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user')));
console.log('Clinic ID:', JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('user'))?.clinicId);
```

## 📝 Data Flow

```

    ↓
razorpayService.handlePaymentSuccess()
    ↓
Save to payment_history table

SubscriptionTab → loadUsageStats()
