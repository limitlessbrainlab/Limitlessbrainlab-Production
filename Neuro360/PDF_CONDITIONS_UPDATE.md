# PDF Report: Show Conditions/Thresholds in Sub-Parameters

## Problem

PDF report me sub-parameters ki interpretation generic thi:
- "✓ Within optimal range"
- "✗ Outside optimal range"

User chahte the ki actual conditions/thresholds dikhni chahiye jaise web UI me dikhtihain:
- "Arousal Score = 1.20 (< 1 is normal)"
- "Relaxation Score = 1.05 (> 10 is healthy per spec)"
- "Alpha Peak = 12.7 Hz at P3 (> 9 is normal)"
- etc.

---

## Root Cause

`geminiPdfGenerator.js` me line 172 hardcoded interpretation use kar raha tha:

**Before:**
```javascript
interpretation: metric.score === 1 ? '✓ Within optimal range' : '✗ Outside optimal range',
details: metric.description || (metric.value !== undefined ? `Value: ${metric.value.toFixed(2)}` : '')
```

**Problem:**
- `metric.description` already had the proper conditions (from `algorithmCalculator.js`)
- But it was being used in `details` field instead of `interpretation`
- PDF was showing generic text instead of actual conditions

---

## Solution

### File Modified: `server/services/geminiPdfGenerator.js`

**Updated Line 169-175:**

**After:**
```javascript
subparameters: subMetrics.map(metric => ({
  name: metric.name || 'Metric',
  score: metric.score !== undefined ? metric.score : (typeof metric.value === 'number' ? metric.value : 0),
  // Use actual description with conditions from algorithmCalculator
  interpretation: metric.description || (metric.score === 1 ? '✓ Within optimal range' : '✗ Outside optimal range'),
  details: metric.value !== undefined && typeof metric.value === 'number' ? `Value: ${metric.value.toFixed(2)}` : ''
}))
```

**What Changed:**
- **Before:** `interpretation` = generic text, `details` = description
- **After:** `interpretation` = description (with conditions), `details` = value (if needed)

---

## How It Works Now

### Data Flow:

1. **`algorithmCalculator.js`** calculates metrics and adds descriptions:
   ```javascript
   // Example: Arousal Score
   {
     value: 1.20,
     score: 0,
     description: "Arousal Score = 1.20 (< 1 is normal)"
   }
   ```

2. **`geminiPdfGenerator.js`** receives this data and uses it:
   ```javascript
   {
     name: "Arousal Score",
     score: 0,
     interpretation: "Arousal Score = 1.20 (< 1 is normal)", // ← Now shows this!
     details: "Value: 1.20"
   }
   ```

3. **PDF displays** the interpretation with conditions

## Source of Descriptions

All descriptions are generated in `server/services/algorithmCalculator.js`:

**Example - Arousal Score (Line 394):**
```javascript
return {
  value: avgRatio,
  score: score,
  description: `Arousal Score = ${avgRatio.toFixed(2)} (< 1 is normal)`,
  details: { fzRatio: fzRatio.toFixed(2), czRatio: czRatio.toFixed(2) }
};
```

**Example - Relaxation Score (Line 448):**
```javascript
return {
  value: ratio,
  score: score,
  description: `Relaxation Score = ${ratio.toFixed(2)} (> 10 is healthy per spec)`
};
```

**Example - Alpha Peak (Line 299):**
```javascript
return {
  value: maxPeak.value,
  score: score,
  description: `Alpha Peak = ${maxPeak.value.toFixed(1)} Hz at ${maxPeak.channel} (> 9 is normal)`,
  details: {
    channel: maxPeak.channel,
    allValues: alphaPeakValues.map(p => `${p.channel}:${p.value.toFixed(1)}Hz`).join(', ')
  }
};
```

## Testing

### Test Case: Generate PDF for Patient with Multiple Parameters
1. Process patient EEG data
2. Generate PDF report
3. Open "Key Metrics" section for each parameter
4. **Expected:** Each sub-parameter shows:
   - Badge (Good/Bad)
   - Metric name
   - **Actual value with condition** (e.g., "= 1.20 (< 1 is normal)")

---

## Channel Data Removed

**User Requirement:** Channel details should not be shown in PDF report

**Before:**
```
[Good] Alpha Peak - Alpha Peak = 12.7 Hz at P3 (> 9 is normal)
       channel: P3
       allValues: Pz:8.1Hz, P3:12.7Hz, P4:12.3Hz
```

**After:**
```
[Good] Alpha Peak - Alpha Peak = 12.7 Hz at P3 (> 9 is normal)
```

**Changes:**
- Removed `details` field display (lines 580-585)
- Removed `details` field assignment (line 174)
- Only main interpretation text is shown
- Channel info in description (like "at P3") is kept as it's part of the main text
