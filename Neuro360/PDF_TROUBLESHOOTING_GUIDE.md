# PDF Download Feature - Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: "PDF Not Generated Yet" Button Remains Disabled

### Step-by-Step Diagnosis

#### 1️⃣ **Check if Backend Server is Running**

The most common reason for PDF generation failure is that the backend server is not running.

**How to Check:**
```bash
# Open a new terminal/command prompt
cd D:\Todays\Neuro360\server
npm start
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Server running on port 3001
Database connected successfully
```

**If you see an error:**
- Make sure dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- Check if port 3001 is already in use
- Check for any error messages in the console

---

#### 2️⃣ **Check Browser Console for Errors**

1. Open your browser (Chrome, Edge, etc.)
2. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
3. Go to the "Console" tab
4. Try saving results again
5. Look for error messages

**Common Error Messages:**

##### Error: "Cannot connect to server"
```
❌ NETWORK ERROR: Cannot connect to backend server
❌ Please ensure backend server is running on http://localhost:3001
```
**Solution:** Backend server is not running. See Step 1 above.

##### Error: "Failed to fetch"
```
TypeError: Failed to fetch
```
**Solution:**
- Backend server is not running
- Or CORS issue (unlikely if both are on localhost)
- Check if backend URL is correct in `.env` file

##### Error: "PDF generation timed out"
```
❌ TIMEOUT ERROR: PDF generation took too long
```
**Solution:**
- Backend server is overloaded or slow
- PDF generation is taking longer than 30 seconds
- Check backend console for errors

---

#### 3️⃣ **Verify Backend Endpoint is Accessible**

Open this URL in your browser:
```
http://localhost:3001/api/qeeg/test
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "QEEG Processing API is working",
  "endpoints": {
    "generatePdf": "POST /api/qeeg/generate-pdf - Generate PDF report from results (PDFKit)",
    ...
  }
}
```

**If this doesn't work:**
- Backend server is not running
- Port 3001 is blocked or in use by another application
- Check firewall settings

---

#### 4️⃣ **Test PDF Generation Directly**

Use this curl command or Postman to test the PDF endpoint directly:

```bash
# Using curl (Git Bash on Windows, or PowerShell with curl installed)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/qeeg/generate-sample-pdf -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "filename": "neurosense-sample-report-xyz.pdf",
    "path": "/uploads/neurosense-sample-report-xyz.pdf",
    "url": "http://localhost:3001/uploads/neurosense-sample-report-xyz.pdf"
  }
}
```

**If this works but frontend doesn't:**
- There's a frontend-backend communication issue
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify `VITE_API_URL` in frontend `.env` file

**If this also fails:**
- PDF generator service has an error
- Check backend console for error details
- Missing dependencies (PDFKit, etc.)

---

#### 5️⃣ **Check Backend Console Output**

When you click "Save to Database", watch the backend terminal for logs:

**Expected Backend Logs:**
```
📄 === PDF Report Generation Started ===

👤 Patient: John Doe
📊 Parameters: 7
📝 Generating PDF to: neurosense-report-john_doe-1732774800000.pdf

✅ PDF Report Generated Successfully!
📄 File: neurosense-report-john_doe-1732774800000.pdf
📊 Size: 245.67 KB

🏁 === PDF Generation Completed ===
```

**If you see errors:**
- Note the exact error message
- Check if the `server/uploads/` directory exists
- Check file permissions

---

#### 6️⃣ **Verify Frontend Environment Variables**

Check if `.env` file exists in project root:

**File: `D:\Todays\Neuro360\.env`**
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
```

**If file doesn't exist or URL is wrong:**
```bash
# Create .env file
echo VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api > .env
```

**Then restart the frontend dev server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Quick Fix Checklist

✅ **Step 1:** Start backend server
```bash
cd server
npm install  # Only needed first time or after pulling changes
npm start
```

✅ **Step 2:** Verify backend is running
```
Open browser: http://localhost:3001/api/qeeg/test
Should see: "QEEG Processing API is working"
```

✅ **Step 3:** Start frontend (if not running)
```bash
cd D:\Todays\Neuro360
npm run dev
```

✅ **Step 4:** Clear browser cache
```
Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete
Clear "Cached images and files"
Or hard reload: Ctrl+Shift+R
```

✅ **Step 5:** Try the flow again
1. Select patient
2. Upload QEEG files
3. Execute calculation
4. Click "Save to Database"
5. Watch console for detailed logs
6. Check if "Download PDF Report" button becomes enabled

## Advanced Debugging

### Enable Verbose Logging

**Frontend Console:**
Already enabled! When you click "Save to Database", you'll see:
```
📝 Starting PDF generation...
🔧 Preparing patient data...
👤 Patient Data: {...}
📊 Algorithm Results: {...}
🌐 Calling backend API: http://localhost:3001/api/qeeg/generate-pdf
📡 Request payload size: 2345 bytes
📡 Backend response status: 200
📦 Backend response data: {...}
✅ PDF generated successfully! {...}
✅ PDF URL: http://localhost:3001/uploads/neurosense-report-xyz.pdf
```

**If you see an error:**
```
❌ Error generating PDF: [error message]
❌ Error name: [error type]
❌ Error message: [detailed message]
```

### Check Network Tab

1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to "Network" tab
3. Click "Save to Database"
4. Look for the request to `/api/qeeg/generate-pdf`
5. Check:
   - Status code (should be 200)
   - Response data
   - Request payload

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Backend Not Starting

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
```

**Solution:**
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

---

### Issue 2: Port 3001 Already in Use

**Symptoms:**
```
Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
```

**Solution:**

**Option A - Kill the process using port 3001:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3001
taskkill /PID [PID_NUMBER] /F

# Or use a different port
# Edit server/index.js or server/server.js
# Change PORT = 3001 to PORT = 3002
```

**Option B - Change backend port:**
1. Edit `server/.env` or server file
2. Change `PORT=3001` to `PORT=3002`
3. Update frontend `.env`: `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3002/api`
4. Restart both servers

---

### Issue 3: CORS Error

**Symptoms:**
```
Access to fetch at 'http://localhost:3001/api/qeeg/generate-pdf' from origin 'http://localhost:5173' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

**Solution:**
Check `server/index.js` or `server/server.js` has CORS enabled:
```javascript
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
```

If missing, add it before your routes.

---

### Issue 4: PDF Generated but Button Still Disabled

**Check 1:** Is `pdfUrl` state being set?
```javascript
// Look for this in console:
✅ PDF generated successfully! { url: "...", path: "...", filename: "..." }
```

**Check 2:** Is the state update happening?
Add this temporarily after line 307 in `AlgorithmDataProcessor.jsx`:
```javascript
console.log('🔍 pdfUrl state value:', pdfUrl);
```

**Check 3:** React state not updating?
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear React DevTools cache
- Restart frontend dev server

---

## Still Not Working?

If none of the above helps:

1. **Check all console logs** (both frontend and backend)
2. **Copy error messages** exactly as shown
3. **Check file permissions** on `server/uploads/` directory
4. **Verify PDFKit is installed:**
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm list pdfkit
   ```
5. **Try generating a sample PDF manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/qeeg/generate-sample-pdf
   ```

## Expected Workflow (When Everything Works)

```
1. User clicks "Save to Database"
   ↓
2. Frontend calls generatePDFReport()
   ↓
3. Frontend prepares patient data, algorithm results, QEEG data
   ↓
4. Frontend sends POST request to backend: /api/qeeg/generate-pdf
   ↓
5. Backend receives request
   ↓
6. Backend creates PDFReportGenerator instance
   ↓
7. Backend generates PDF file in server/uploads/
   ↓
8. Backend returns { success: true, data: { filename, path, url } }
   ↓
9. Frontend receives response
   ↓
10. Frontend sets pdfUrl state
   ↓
11. React re-renders with pdfUrl !== null
   ↓
12. "Download PDF Report" button becomes ENABLED ✅
   ↓
13. User clicks button → PDF opens in new tab
```

## Quick Start (If Starting Fresh)

```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd D:\Todays\Neuro360\server
npm install
npm start

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd D:\Todays\Neuro360
npm install
npm run dev

# Browser
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Go to Algorithm Data Processor
# Select patient → Upload files → Execute → Save → Download PDF ✅
```
