# ✅ Razorpay Error FIXED!

## 🔍 What Was The Problem?

Looking at your screenshot showing **500 Internal Server Error** and **wrong Razorpay key**, I found the ROOT CAUSE:

### Your `.env` file had WRONG credentials!

**WRONG credentials (what was in .env):**
```
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_RIGlEwt9XmHpJ5
VITE_RAZORPAY_SECRET=3rEPNllZZawGmT3PQ5AgvL47
```

**CORRECT credentials (what you told me to use):**
```
VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_xhAJH2vAW4eXzu
VITE_RAZORPAY_SECRET=n5yZEg1JJByd2zdMWOKLpo5r
```

### Why You Saw Different Errors:

1. **First screenshot:** Browser cache serving old credentials → 401 error
2. **Second screenshot:** Still cached credentials → 401 error
3. **Latest screenshot:** Wrong credentials from .env → 500 Internal Server Error

The key in your error URL showed: `rzp_liv_B9B1209...` (corrupted/wrong key)

## 🔴 If Still Not Working

If you STILL see errors after running the script:

### Option A: Manually verify .env file

1. Open `D:\Neuro360\.env` in Notepad
2. Find these lines:
   ```
   VITE_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_live_xhAJH2vAW4eXzu
   VITE_RAZORPAY_SECRET=n5yZEg1JJByd2zdMWOKLpo5r
   ```
3. Ensure NO extra spaces, NO quotes, EXACT values

### Option B: Nuclear option

If nothing else works:
```
Double-click: NUCLEAR_FIX.bat
```
This will delete and reinstall everything from scratch.
