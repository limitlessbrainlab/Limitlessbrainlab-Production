## 🔍 Verification

### Build Status
✅ **Project builds successfully** without any AWS-related errors

### Code References
All AWS/DynamoDB references in code have been:
- ✅ Replaced with Supabase equivalents
- ✅ Updated in comments to reflect new database backend

### Remaining AWS Mentions
Only documentation files that reference AWS in historical context:
- `AWS_TO_SUPABASE_MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - Migration history (can be kept for reference)

## ✨ What's Now Using Supabase

### Storage Operations
**New Service**: `apps/web/src/services/storageService.js`
- Upload files to Supabase Storage bucket `patient-reports`
- Generate signed URLs for secure file access
- Delete, download, list, move, and copy files
- File validation (200MB limit, multiple file types)

### Database Operations
**Existing Service**: `apps/web/src/services/databaseService.js`
- Uses Supabase Database (PostgreSQL)
- Handles all CRUD operations
- localStorage fallback for offline support

### Files Updated to Use Supabase
1. ✅ `apps/web/src/components/clinic/UploadReportModal.jsx`
2. ✅ `apps/web/src/components/clinic/PatientManagement.jsx`
3. ✅ `apps/web/src/components/admin/PatientReports.jsx`
4. ✅ `apps/web/src/components/admin/PaymentHistory.jsx`
5. ✅ `apps/web/src/services/reportWorkflowService.js`
6. ✅ `apps/web/src/services/razorpayService.js`

## 🎯 Current Project State

### Environment Variables
```env
# Supabase Configuration (Active)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://omyltmcesgbhnqmhrrvq.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
VITE_SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=patient-reports

# AWS Configuration
❌ All AWS environment variables REMOVED
```

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "✅ @supabase/supabase-js": "^2.57.4",  // Active
  "❌ @aws-sdk/*": "REMOVED"              // Deleted
}
```

### Storage Backend
- **Before**: AWS S3
- **After**: Supabase Storage (bucket: `patient-reports`)

### Database Backend
- **Before**: AWS DynamoDB + localStorage fallback
- **After**: Supabase PostgreSQL + localStorage fallback

## 📦 Next Steps

### If Bucket Not Yet Configured
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com/project/omyltmcesgbhnqmhrrvq
2. Navigate to **Storage**
3. **Save** the `patient-reports` bucket if you haven't
4. Add **RLS policies** (see `RLS_POLICIES.sql`)
5. Run test: `node test-supabase-storage.js`

### Start Development
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

### Test File Uploads
1. Open application in browser
2. Go to Admin > Patient Reports
3. Upload a test PDF file
4. Verify file appears in Supabase Storage dashboard

## 🆘 Rollback (If Needed)

If you need to restore AWS files (not recommended):
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- "*aws*" "*dynamodb*" "*AWS*"
git checkout <commit-hash> -- <file-path>
```

However, this is **NOT recommended** as:
- AWS dependencies were removed from package.json
- Code has been updated to use Supabase
- Environment variables have been changed
- A full rollback would require significant rework
