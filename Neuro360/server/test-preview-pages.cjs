While your brain manages basic cognitive tasks, there are clear areas where efficiency can be improved. Targeted brain training, regular physical exercise, and optimizing sleep quality can help elevate your cognitive performance.',

While your brain shows adequate information processing and memory function, there are opportunities to enhance cognitive efficiency. Targeted brain training, lifestyle adjustments, and stress management can help optimize your mental performance.',

Your neural patterns indicate optimal information processing and strong executive function. Continue maintaining these healthy brain habits.'

The brain remains in a heightened alert state, leading to mental fatigue, emotional reactivity, and difficulty recovering. Immediate prioritization of daily resets, stress boundaries, body regulation through movement, and consistent recovery routines is strongly recommended.',
      moderate: 'Moderate stress levels detected in your brain activity patterns. While your brain manages everyday demands reasonably well, there are signs of tension that may affect cognitive performance under prolonged pressure. Incorporating regular relaxation techniques, mindfulness practices, and recovery breaks can help strengthen your stress resilience.',
      mild: 'Mild stress levels detected. Your brain shows generally good stress regulation with minor areas for improvement. You handle most daily demands well, though occasional tension may arise under prolonged pressure. Maintaining regular relaxation practices and recovery breaks will help sustain your stress resilience.',

You can handle pressure without feeling overwhelmed, staying calm, focused, and productive even in demanding situations. Your neural patterns reflect a well-regulated stress response system that supports overall cognitive function and well-being.'

Attention is influenced by multiple brainwave states, particularly beta waves and theta waves. Implementing structured focus techniques such as the Pomodoro method, mindfulness meditation, and physical exercise can help improve these capabilities.',

While your brain can engage with tasks, you may find it challenging to resist distractions or maintain mental effort consistently. Practicing focused attention exercises, reducing digital distractions, and incorporating regular breaks can help strengthen your attentional control.',
      moderate: 'Focus and attention are crucial for cognitive performance, learning, and productivity. Your metrics show moderate ability to maintain concentration on a task, resist distractions, and sustain mental effort over time. An optimal balance between beta waves (linked to active thinking) and theta waves (associated with deep concentration) can be enhanced through targeted training.',

You may feel overwhelmed easily and find it extremely difficult to stay consistent even with simple routines. Immediate prioritization of recovery breaks, sleep hygiene, energy pacing, and stress regulation is strongly recommended.',
      moderate: 'Moderate burnout and fatigue detected. Your brain manages demands reasonably well but shows signs of accumulated mental load that may affect sustained performance. Adding short recovery breaks between tasks, maintaining consistent sleep hygiene, and pacing energy throughout the day can help prevent further buildup.',
      mild: 'Mild burnout and fatigue detected. Your brain maintains reasonable energy levels with minor signs of accumulated load. You generally manage workload demands well, though occasional fatigue may arise during extended periods of effort. Maintaining recovery breaks and consistent sleep hygiene will help sustain your energy levels.',

Emotional recovery after stress may be considerably slower. Practicing daily awareness, breath regulation, and response gap training can help strengthen emotional balance.',

You may experience heightened reactivity in certain situations and find it takes longer to recover emotionally. Building daily awareness practices, breath regulation techniques, and constructive reframing can help improve your emotional resilience.',

Strengthening mindful emotional check-ins, breath regulation, and constructive reframing can enhance your emotional resilience and stability.',

You can experience emotions fully without being overwhelmed, remain composed during challenges, and recover quickly after emotional stress. This supports clear thinking, confident decision-making, and healthy relationships.'

      mild: 'Your learning capacity shows mild performance, indicating some challenges with information retention and applying new concepts. While you can take in new material, it may require more effort and repetition to fully absorb and apply it. Structured learning techniques like spaced repetition, active recall, and chunking information can help enhance your learning efficiency.',

Strengthening learning through spaced repetition, active practice questions, chunking information, and maintaining a consistent study routine can enhance your learning efficiency.',

You may rely heavily on structured, rule-based thinking and struggle with abstract or open-ended tasks. Scheduling no-input time, changing environments, and practicing the two-mode rule (brainstorm first, edit later) can help stimulate creative potential.',
      mild: 'Your creativity levels show mild performance, suggesting some difficulty with flexible thinking and generating novel ideas. While you can follow established patterns, you may find it challenging to think outside the box or approach problems from unconventional angles. Engaging in free-form brainstorming, exploring new environments, and separating idea generation from evaluation can help unlock creative potential.',

    title: 'ALPHA ASYMMETRY',
    description: 'Alpha Asymmetry refers to the difference in alpha brainwave activity between the left and right frontal regions when the eyes are closed. This parameter provides insight into emotional style, motivation patterns, and approach-avoidance tendencies. Balanced alpha activity between hemispheres supports emotional stability, motivation, and adaptive responses.',
    highCognition: {
      title: 'Left Alpha Asymmetry',
      paragraphs: [
        'The left frontal cortex is strongly associated with positive affect, motivation, and goal-directed behavior.',
        'When asymmetry reflects reduced left-frontal activation, it may influence mood regulation and drive.'
      ],
      implications: [
        'May be linked with low mood, reduced motivation, or decreased enthusiasm.',
        'Slower task initiation and lower reward responsiveness.',
        'Can contribute to emotional withdrawal or reduced engagement in challenging situations.'
      ]
    },
    lowCognition: {
      title: 'Right Alpha Asymmetry',
      paragraphs: [
        'The right frontal cortex is closely associated with emotional vigilance, stress response, and threat monitoring.',
        'When asymmetry favors right-sided dysregulation, it may reflect heightened emotional reactivity and anxiety tendency.'
      ],
      implications: [
        'May present as overthinking, worry, or heightened sensitivity to stress.',
        'Increased vigilance and difficulty "switching off" the mind under pressure.',
        'Can contribute to restlessness, anticipatory anxiety, or stress-driven decision patterns.'
      ]
    },
    howToImprove: [
      'Breath regulation practices (slow exhalation breathing / alternate nostril breathing) to calm right-sided anxiety activation.',
      'Goal activation training (small, structured task-start routines) to strengthen left frontal engagement.',
      'Mindfulness and emotional labeling to improve limbic-frontal integration.',
      'Alpha-based neuro feedback or HRV coherence training for improving hemispheric balance.'
